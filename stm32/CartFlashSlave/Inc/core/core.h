/*
 * @brief Sets priority grouping scheme for NVIC.
 *
 * @details
 * This function sets NVIC to predefined interrupt priority grouping.
 * Possible priority groupings depends on the uC and its ARM core,
 * since these are closely coupled.
 *
 * I.e. for STM32F401 there are 4 bits used for priority (meaning there are 16 levels of priority)
 * and this priority can be divided into: preemption (group) priority and subpriority.
 *
 * Any IRQ (like IRQ for the UART, EXTI, SPI, Timers, ...) can then have a priority assigned
 * (preemption and subpriority).
 *
 * IRQs within the same preemption priority do not preempt each other.
 * This means that during one IRQ execution, new IRQ that occurs cannot break the current IRQ execution.
 * Instead it will have to wait until current IRQ execution ends.
 * The lower the subpriority, the greater the priority of the IRQ, giving it the precedence for the next IRQ execution.
 *
 * IRQs from different preemption priorities preempt each other.
 * This means that during one IRQ execution, new IRQ that occurs can break the current IRQ execution.
 * (if the new IRQ has lower preemption priority).
 * When the new IRQ ends, execution goes back to the previous IRQ that was under execution.
 * The lower the preemption priority, the greater the priority of the IRQ, giving it the precedence for the next IRQ execution.
 *
 * @param priority_grouping - desired priority grouping scheme.
 *         This parameter can be one of the following values:
 *         @arg CORE_NVIC_PRIOGRP_0_4: 0 bits for preemption priority
 *                                    4 bits for subpriority
 *         @arg CORE_NVIC_PRIOGRP_1_3: 1 bits for preemption priority
 *                                    3 bits for subpriority
 *         @arg CORE_NVIC_PRIOGRP_2_2: 2 bits for preemption priority
 *                                    2 bits for subpriority
 *         @arg CORE_NVIC_PRIOGRP_3_1: 3 bits for preemption priority
 *                                    1 bits for subpriority
 *         @arg CORE_NVIC_PRIOGRP_4_0: 4 bits for preemption priority
 *                                    0 bits for subpriority
 *
 * The group priorities of Reset, NMI and HardFault are -3, -2, and -1 respectively, regardless of the value of PRIGROUP.

 * @brief Configures and enables ARM Systick Timer.

 * @details
 * This function sets the Systick Timer interval, sets the Systick Interrupt (SysTick_IRQn) priority
 * and enables this timer along with its interrupt.
 *
 * @note: this function is based on SysTick_Config() from core_cm4.h
 * It's just own implementation.
 *
 * @param interval Number of clock ticks needed for the Systick Timer Interrupt to occur.
 * Systick Timer is being clocked with the same frequency as core (HCLK).
 * Example: if you have HCLK = 84 MHz (84M ticks per second), and you want SysTick Timer to give you interrupts
 * every 1ms, you should set interval to 84000.
 * @param preeprio - Preemption priority for the SysTick Timer Interrupt.
 * @param subprio - Subpriority for the SysTick Timer Interrupt.
 * @returns core_ec_t
 * @retval CORE_EC_SUCCES Means the function succeeded.
 * @retval CORE_EC_FAILED Means the function failed.
